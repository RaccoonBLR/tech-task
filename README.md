# Start exploring TWTR APP

This project was developed with Create React App. The application implements
routing and redirection using react-router. Also in the application, you can
interact with other users using a subscription. For convenient interaction with
user cards, you have the ability to filter users by subscription status, and the
load more button allows you to receive user cards in a limited number using
pagination. Application uses its own custom backend API created with the
mockapi.io service.
